<clue>Thus, our data provide novel evidence that selective modulation of NF-kappaB by adenoviral transfer of IkappaB-alpha impairs the expression of multiple endothelial gene products required for subsequent monocyte arrest and <clueType>emigration</clueType> <clueLoc>in shear flow</clueLoc> and thus for monocyte infiltration in atherosclerotic plaques.</clue>
